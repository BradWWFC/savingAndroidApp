# savingAndroidApp
A simple android app that helps me keep track of how much i have saved and how much i need to add to my account. 

This app was created to track my savings whilst i followed the [1p Saving Challenge](https://skintdad.co.uk/skint-52-week-saving-challenge/). The app displays two numbers:
* The amount that has been saved since the start point.
* The amount that I need to add to the total.
When the user presses the 'update' button, the second amount is reset to zero.
